            Ashoka, also spelled Aśoka, (died 238? bce, India), last major
            emperor of the Mauryan dynasty of India. His vigorous patronage of
            Buddhism during his reign (c. 265–238 bce; also given as c. 273–232
            bce) furthered the expansion of that religion throughout India.
            Following his successful but bloody conquest of the Kalinga country
            on the east coast, Ashoka renounced armed conquest and adopted a
            policy that he called “conquest by dharma” (i.e., by principles of
            right life).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In order to gain wide publicity for his teachings and his work,
            Ashoka made them known by means of oral announcements and by
            engravings on rocks and pillars at suitable sites.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These inscriptions—the rock edicts and pillar edicts (e.g., the lion
            capital of the pillar found at Sarnath, which has become India’s
            national emblem), mostly dated in various years of his reign—contain
            statements regarding his thoughts and actions and provide
            information on his life and acts. His utterances rang of frankness
            and sincerity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            According to his own accounts, Ashoka conquered the Kalinga country
            (modern Orissa state) in the eighth year of his reign. The
            sufferings that the war inflicted on the defeated people moved him
            to such remorse that he renounced armed conquests. It was at this
            time that he came in touch with Buddhism and adopted it. Under its
            influence and prompted by his own dynamic temperament, he resolved
            to live according to, and preach, the dharma and to serve his
            subjects and all humanity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ashoka repeatedly declared that he understood dharma to be the
            energetic practice of the sociomoral virtues of honesty,
            truthfulness, compassion, mercifulness, benevolence, nonviolence,
            considerate behaviour toward all, “little sin and many good deeds,”
            nonextravagance, nonacquisitiveness, and noninjury to animals. He
            spoke of no particular mode of religious creed or worship, nor of
            any philosophical doctrines. He spoke of Buddhism only to his
            coreligionists and not to others.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Toward all religious sects he adopted a policy of respect and
            guaranteed them full freedom to live according to their own
            principles, but he also urged them to exert themselves for the
            “increase of their inner worthiness.” Moreover, he exhorted them to
            respect the creeds of others, praise the good points of others, and
            refrain from vehement adverse criticism of the viewpoints of others.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To practice the dharma actively, Ashoka went out on periodic tours
            preaching the dharma to the rural people and relieving their
            sufferings. He ordered his high officials to do the same, in
            addition to attending to their normal duties; he exhorted
            administrative officers to be constantly aware of the joys and
            sorrows of the common folk and to be prompt and impartial in
            dispensing justice. A special class of high officers, designated
            “dharma ministers,” was appointed to foster dharma work by the
            public, relieve suffering wherever found, and look to the special
            needs of women, of people inhabiting outlying regions, of
            neighbouring peoples, and of various religious communities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It was ordered that matters concerning public welfare were to be
            reported to him at all times. The only glory he sought, he said, was
            for having led his people along the path of dharma. No doubts are
            left in the minds of readers of his inscriptions regarding his
            earnest zeal for serving his subjects.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            More success was attained in his work, he said, by reasoning with
            people than by issuing commands. Among his works of public utility
            were the founding of hospitals for people and animals, the planting
            of roadside trees and groves, the digging of wells, and the
            construction of watering sheds and rest houses. Orders were also
            issued for curbing public laxities and preventing cruelty to
            animals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With the death of Ashoka, the Mauryan empire disintegrated and his
            work was discontinued. His memory survives for what he attempted to
            achieve and the high ideals he held before himself.Among his works

            achieve and the high ideals he held before himself. Most enduring
            were Ashoka’s services to Buddhism. He built a number of stupas
            (commemorative burial mounds) and monasteries and erected pillars on
            which he ordered inscribed his understanding of religious doctrines.
            He took strong measures to suppress schisms within the sangha (the
            Buddhist religious community) and prescribed a course of scriptural
            studies for adherents.

            The Sinhalese chronicle Mahavamsa says that when the order decided
            to send preaching missions abroad, Ashoka helped them
            enthusiastically and sent his own son and daughter as missionaries
            to Sri Lanka. It is as a result of Ashoka’s patronage that Buddhism,
            which until then was a small sect confined to particular localities,
            spread throughout India and subsequently beyond the frontiers of the
            country.
